> ### Usage of REST APIs are showcased in this project:

When should we use:

* **GET Request** - When you request non-critical data such as getting any url or webpage, you use GET Method. It is implemented by default. It has certain limit.
* **POST Request** - When you request a critical information such as your username, password and you dont want it to show in url, you use POST method. It has some headers which make it secure. We need to mention csrf token with it.
